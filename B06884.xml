            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A CONGRATULARY POEM On the Right Honourable Sir PATIENCE WARD, Knight and Baronet, LORD MAYOR of the City of LONDON.</head>
            <l>AS when Ambaſſadors from Princes come,</l>
            <l>We all by cuſtom from our Houſes run</l>
            <l>To ſee the Stranger, Great, the Noble High,</l>
            <l>The Repreſentive of a Deity.</l>
            <l>Scripture and Reaſon ſtile them ſo by Birth,</l>
            <l>Great Men; like Kings, are ſtill like Gods on Earth:</l>
            <l>The truth of which, no Juſt Man can deny,</l>
            <l>Being ordain'd by heavenly deſtiny.</l>
            <l>But why it ſhould be thus, I cannot ſay,</l>
            <l>Then what ſhall happen the ſucceeding Day,</l>
            <l>Being a Secret kept in Heavens own hand,</l>
            <l>As Rain deſcends on good and barren Land.</l>
            <l>Yet in a worldly ſenſe it may be taken</l>
            <l>For Natural Reaſon, and not be forſaken,</l>
            <l>Becauſe busineſs of that important nature</l>
            <l>It very nearly doth concern each creature,</l>
            <l>As Natives of their own fine Country dear,</l>
            <l>To whom, of all things, ſtill they ſhould be near:</l>
            <l>Much more at a Magiſtrate of our own,</l>
            <l>Becauſe his Power extends throughout the Town,</l>
            <l>Being an Office 'twixt Country and City,</l>
            <l>That all therein does ſhare, both fools and witty.</l>
            <l>Since next the King, to him we owe all things,</l>
            <l>Peace, Plenty, Trade, and Money-offrings:</l>
            <l>For by his wiſe Conduct, and Prudence high,</l>
            <l>He'l make our Fame reach to the ſtarry Sky,</l>
            <l>Being a man by Nature, and by Name,</l>
            <l>To be a Soul wrapt in immortal Fame.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Patience</hi> by Name, a Virtue great and high,</l>
            <l>Burning and ſhining like the Sun in th'Sky;</l>
            <l>Endow'd with Learning, and ſuch famous Arts,</l>
            <l>That by their force he ſoon will gain our hearts;</l>
            <l>Adorning of him in this his humane Race,</l>
            <l>More than his <hi>Indian</hi> Pearl, or his Gold Lace.</l>
            <l>Since Virtue's a colour of that deep hue,</l>
            <l>That 'tis as Rich as the gay Rainbow's blue.</l>
            <l>The Merchant traffiques where he pleaſe to go;</l>
            <l>So Virtue trades with Heaven and Earth below.</l>
            <l>Philoſophers ſay, ſhe's th' Glory of each one,</l>
            <l>As the pretty Flower's guilded by the Sun.</l>
            <l>Logicians ſay, as well to each degree,</l>
            <l>You'r happy ſtill in your Humanity;</l>
            <l>For Bodies ſhap't, and ſo proportion'd well,</l>
            <l>Are <hi>ab Origine,</hi> from Heaven, not Hell.</l>
            <l>Seraphick Love alwaies prefers its own,</l>
            <l>As the kind Father ſtrongly loves his Son.</l>
            <l>The Speech you made, it doth ſo plainly tell</l>
            <l>How many Virtues in your Mind doth dwell;</l>
            <l>As the Tree is, alike is ſtill the Fruit,</l>
            <l>Or the gay Summer with dull Winter ſuit.</l>
            <l>When the Sun-ſhines, 'tis then a pleaſant day,</l>
            <l>And when not ſeen, 'tis a foul After-play</l>
            <l>So as we look and ſpeak, ſuch men we are,</l>
            <l>A Maxim of the Learn'd Philoſopher,</l>
            <l>Telling how face and heart do go together,</l>
            <l>Making men to enjoy the beſt weather;</l>
            <l>While other platforms of a lower of die,</l>
            <l>Are but mere Strangers to humanity;</l>
            <l>Like the dull Carrier's Horſe, that ſtill moves on</l>
            <l>In the ſame road, until he cometh home;</l>
            <l>Then doth grim death approach, and tell them all,</l>
            <l>His never failing dart will make them fall.</l>
            <l>But that for ever they muſt paſs and go</l>
            <l>To Heaven's glory, or to Hell's Sorrow.</l>
            <l>Seamen and Pilots rule their manners ſtill,</l>
            <l>According to their Captain, good or ill;</l>
            <l>Who from him no other Religion take,</l>
            <l>Nay Navigation itſelf forſake;</l>
            <l>As he inſtructed is in every Art,</l>
            <l>The Legiſlator to his better heart:</l>
            <l>Even ſo as a great man or Ruler's given,</l>
            <l>Each Man's prone, to make him ſtill his Heaven.</l>
            <l>As he ſmiles; then we look brisk and gay,</l>
            <l>As all things flouriſh in the Month of <hi>May:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But if he looks but angry, and he frown.</l>
            <l>So then do we, and all our mirth is gone.</l>
            <l>Shewing th' inconſtancy of joy in all,</l>
            <l>Of Lunaries and Terreſtrial:</l>
            <l>So that Example will be known and ſeen</l>
            <l>Like a bright Dutcheſs or an <hi>Indian</hi> Queen.</l>
            <l>'Tis plain both from experience and from Reaſon,</l>
            <l>Things that are always certain and in ſeaſon:</l>
            <l>For Natureſhews all things are fed by ſenſe,</l>
            <l>And their ſuperior bodies influence</l>
            <l>All their kind heats, by which they ſtill are fed,</l>
            <l>Flow from thoſe ſtreams, and ſo are nouriſhed.</l>
            <l>Since Heavens ſuperior as we plainly ſee,</l>
            <l>As Man excells Beaſts in Felicity:</l>
            <l>For he that makes doth top the Object gay,</l>
            <l>As Night is but the Curtain of the day.</l>
            <l>In ſhort, welcome great Sir, unto your Seat,</l>
            <l>A place of Honour and of high Retreat:</l>
            <l>To all you'r welcome, and to all moſt near,</l>
            <l>To all Prince, Virtue ſtill does make you dear.</l>
            <l>Since blood with the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> porcends</l>
            <l>Things that are great, and you for greater ends:</l>
            <l>For Virtue riſes from the Plant moſt rare,</l>
            <l>As trees in Summer ſtill moſt fruitful are.</l>
            <l>Great Sir all happineſs attend you ſtill,</l>
            <l>That you may paſs the great Gunſhot of ill,</l>
            <l>And when Death ſummons you, that you appear,</l>
            <l>You ſhall with Angels gay, look bright and clear.</l>
            <l>I leave you as a Preſident for Sages,</l>
            <l>To future times, and to ſucceeding Ages.</l>
